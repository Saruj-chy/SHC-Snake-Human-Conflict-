# SHC(Snake Human Conflict)

Collection and analysis of those memories may provide vital information for nature research. An app is developed for collecting data about snakes and bite incidents that occurred within the Bangladesh boundary. This app is free of cost for the user. Data collected by this application will be used for research purposes. Your data will be secured. Using this application, you will be able to capture snakesâ€™ picture instantly and upload here. In case of instant upload will record the GPS location, a necessary information to authenticate the snake location. The app is easy to operate and supported on any android version.
After installation there are two options for data submission.

1. You have sighted a snake just now, then open this application, take the picture of that snake from a safe distance, and post it with answers to our three questions with your mobile phone number. Your mobile number will be used only for snake related information justification.
   Note: Please take pictures from a safe distance. Try to have a clear picture but do not try to go near to a live snake.
2. Another option is from your stored picture. Suppose you have taken a picture of a snake. But you could not upload due to internet connection. You can upload it when you are available with internet connection. Here you have to give obvious information about the location of sighting, eg., Name of the Village, Upazilla and district. This information is only for authentication for the supplied data.
